=====================================
FogLAMP "FFT" C++ Filter plugin
=====================================

A filter that applies a FFT algorithm to a set of readings.

Configuration
-------------

The filter supports the following set of configuration options

asset
  The asset to apply the FFT filter to

bands
  The number of frequency bands to define the resultant FFT output into

samples
  The number of input samples to use. This must be a power of 2.

Build
-----
To build FogLAMP "FFT" C++ filter plugin:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

- By default the FogLAMP develop package header files and libraries
  are expected to be located in /usr/include/foglamp and /usr/lib/foglamp
- If **FOGLAMP_ROOT** env var is set and no -D options are set,
  the header files and libraries paths are pulled from the ones under the
  FOGLAMP_ROOT directory.
  Please note that you must first run 'make' in the FOGLAMP_ROOT directory.

You may also pass one or more of the following options to cmake to override 
this default behaviour:

- **FOGLAMP_SRC** sets the path of a FogLAMP source tree
- **FOGLAMP_INCLUDE** sets the path to FogLAMP header files
- **FOGLAMP_LIB sets** the path to FogLAMP libraries
- **FOGLAMP_INSTALL** sets the installation path of Random plugin

NOTE:
 - The **FOGLAMP_INCLUDE** option should point to a location where all the FogLAMP 
   header files have been installed in a single directory.
 - The **FOGLAMP_LIB** option should point to a location where all the FogLAMP
   libraries have been installed in a single directory.
 - 'make install' target is defined only when **FOGLAMP_INSTALL** is set

Examples:

- no options

  $ cmake ..

- no options and FOGLAMP_ROOT set

  $ export FOGLAMP_ROOT=/some_foglamp_setup

  $ cmake ..

- set FOGLAMP_SRC

  $ cmake -DFOGLAMP_SRC=/home/source/develop/FogLAMP  ..

- set FOGLAMP_INCLUDE

  $ cmake -DFOGLAMP_INCLUDE=/dev-package/include ..
- set FOGLAMP_LIB

  $ cmake -DFOGLAMP_LIB=/home/dev/package/lib ..
- set FOGLAMP_INSTALL

  $ cmake -DFOGLAMP_INSTALL=/home/source/develop/FogLAMP ..

  $ cmake -DFOGLAMP_INSTALL=/usr/local/foglamp ..

*****************************
Packaging for 'FFT' filter
*****************************

This repo contains the scripts used to create a foglamp-filter-fft Debian package.

The make_deb script
===================

Run the make_deb command after compiling the plugin:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./make_deb help
  make_deb {x86|arm} [help|clean|cleanall]
  This script is used to create the Debian package of FoglAMP C++ 'fft' filter plugin
  Arguments:
   help     - Display this help text
   x86      - Build an x86_64 package
   arm      - Build an armv7l package
   clean    - Remove all the old versions saved in format .XXXX
   cleanall - Remove all the versions, including the last one
  $

Building a Package
==================

Finally, run the ``make_deb`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./make_deb
   The package root directory is   : /home/ubuntu/source/foglamp-filter-fft
   The FogLAMP required version    : >=1.4
   The package will be built in    : /home/ubuntu/source/foglamp-filter-fft/packages/build
   The architecture is set as      : x86_64
   The package name is             : foglamp-filter-fft-1.0.0-x86_64

   Populating the package and updating version file...Done.
   Building the new package...
   dpkg-deb: building package 'foglamp-filter-fft' in 'foglamp-filter-fft-1.0.0-x86_64.deb'.
   Building Complete.
   $

Cleaning the Package Folder
===========================

Use the ``clean`` option to remove all the old packages and the files used to make the package.

Use the ``cleanall`` option to remove all the packages and the files used to make the package.
